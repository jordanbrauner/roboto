#Roboto#

###Overview###

A sci-fi themed crowdfunding app from the future.

Roboto was initially as a quick portfolio piece built to facilitate my learning of the MEAN stack. Shortly after development started I decided to switch over to Angular on Rails and make the core of the app more modular. The sci-fi aspect of Roboto is now merely a just-for-fun theme of what is going to be a relatively full featured crowdfunding app (while also being a testbed for learning new technologies).

###Technologies used###

**Roboto**: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.JS, AngularJS, Grunt.js, and the BEM methodology.

**Roboto API**: Ruby on Rails, Postgresql.

###Current state of the app###
Roboto is currently very early in development. Basic features beyond CRUD for robots and contributions are currently being built.
